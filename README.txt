CivilArk Singleplayer Guide

The Singleplayer folder in CivilArk may initially appear empty. However, once the game is launched, the following files will be generated automatically:

Generated Files:

1. map_for_now.jpg: A dynamically updated map image reflecting the current state of the game after every operation.


2. player_account.txt: Contains user account details.


3. data.json: Stores the game data for the singleplayer session.

Changing Accounts:

To switch accounts in singleplayer mode, edit the player_account.txt file in the same format as used in multiplayer mode:

USERNAME: <your_username>  
PASSWORD: <your_password>

Save the file and relaunch the game to apply the changes.

Enjoy your singleplayer journey in CivilArk!
