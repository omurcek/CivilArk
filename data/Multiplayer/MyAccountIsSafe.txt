CivilArk Password Security Analysis

CivilArk places great importance on player account security and uses strong algorithms to protect your passwords. Cracking your account password is nearly impossible. Now, let's go through the detailed calculations:


---

Calculating Password Combinations

Each password in CivilArk can be between 10 and 32 characters long, with each character chosen from 81 different symbols.

For each password length, the number of possible combinations is calculated as follows:

81^10, 81^11, 81^12, ..., 81^32

By summing these values, we determine the total number of possible password combinations:

Sum from n=10 to n=32 of 81^n

This value represents the total number of unique passwords that can be generated in CivilArk.


---

Calculating Storage Space Required

Since each password has a specific length, we can calculate the total storage required by multiplying these combinations by their respective lengths:

Sum from n=10 to n=32 of (81^n * n)

This value gives the total storage space required for all CivilArk passwords.

Now, let’s convert this total byte value into more understandable units.


---

Converting Data Size to Larger Units

We will now convert the total byte size into KB, MB, GB, TB, and PB using the following formulas:

Total Bytes / 1024 = KB KB / 1024 = MB MB / 1024 = GB GB / 1024 = TB TB / 1024 = PB

From these calculations, we can see that storing all possible passwords requires an unimaginably large amount of storage.


---

Calculating Brute-Force Time Required

Now, let's estimate how long it would take for an attacker to crack a CivilArk password using brute-force.

To find an average brute-force duration, we divide the total number of combinations by two:

Total Combinations / 2

Assuming the attacker can attempt 0.10 passwords per second, we calculate the total time required:

Average Combinations / 0.10

To express this result in years, we convert seconds into minutes, hours, days, and years:

Total Time (seconds) / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365)

This gives us the total number of years required to crack a password using brute-force.

Additional Security Measures

1. Passwords are never sent to the client in plain text.

This means your password cannot be leaked from CivilArk servers.



2. Passwords are securely hashed and stored.

Even if the system is compromised, your password remains nearly impossible to decrypt.

Final Results

CivilArk's password security is exceptionally strong, making brute-force attacks practically impossible.

1. Total number of possible password combinations:

11,937,561,884,960,315,461,164,883,772,180,175,148,999,189,085,208,470,884,749,063


2. Total storage required for all possible passwords:

3. Estimated brute-force cracking time:

1,892,688,020,827,041,052,125,731,013,273,574,847,604,836,848,675,848,192 years



This means that even with modern technology, CivilArk passwords cannot be cracked using brute-force attacks.

Conclusion

CivilArk passwords have an astronomical number of possible combinations (11 octillion).

Storing all possible passwords would require an impossible amount of storage (339 million petabytes).

Brute-force attacks would take 1,892 quintillion years, making them completely infeasible.


These calculations demonstrate that CivilArk’s password encryption system is extremely secure, and brute-force attacks are not a realistic threat.

CivilArk ensures the highest level of security for your passwords and keeps your account safe!
